Q1 : Because new technology are always coming up and if you had stay aware of where the industry is headed,switch your jobs into a new technology and plan your career and projects accordingly. It will open your eyes to different ways of approaching tasks for the buisness.

Q2: 1. Don’t try to refactor and add functionality at the same time.

2. Make sure you have good tests before you begin refactoring. Run the tests as often as possible. That way you will know quickly if your changes have broken anything.
3. Refactoring often in- volves making many localized changes that result in a larger-scale change. If you keep your steps small, and test after each step, you will avoid prolonged debugging.

Q3: A release backlog is a subset of the product backlog that is planned to be delivered in the coming release. It would presumably contain the same type of items as on a product backlog

Q4: Velocity is a measure from the amount of work and the total effort that team is capable of in a sprint. The number is calculated from adding all the story points from the last sprint’s stories and totaling the points for all fully completed User Stories.

Q5: It'a a daily standup meeting to ensure the meeting is short and it's gonna be in the morning.
